=head1 NAME

Perl6:: - Parse a file and returns a type graph.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Perl6::Type;

    # create and name it
    my $type = Perl6::Type.new(:name("Rat"));

    # add some properties 
    $type.super.push(["Any", "Mu", "Numeric"]);
    $type.roles.push(["Role1", "Role2"]);

    # and get its MRO!
    say $type.mro;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl6::Typegraph represents a type in the Perl6 language. It stores 
its parent classes and the role it's implementing. In addition, it also
stores the inverted relation, that's to say: all types inheriting from 
this one, and if it's a role, all types implementing it.
